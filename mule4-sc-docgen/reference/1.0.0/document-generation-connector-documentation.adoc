== Operations

[[FinalizeDraftNonMultiPart]]
== Finalize Draft
`<sc-docgen:finalize-draft-non-multi-part>`


Renders a draft document to its final format. If you generate a draft document on the cloud, you need to edit the draft document and finalize the draft document on the cloud. If you generate a draft document on an appliance, you need to edit the draft document and finalize the draft document on the appliance. When calling the API on an appliance you must ensure the user specified during authentication is from the same tenancy as the User ID set on the Configuration page of the appliance web control panel. The following properties can be used as property values in the draft request. The properties available to render a draft document are: Property nameDescriptionDefault valuemerge.pdfIf you have a PDF primary document with PDF enclosures, the enclosures are merged with the primary document to give a single PDF. This merging process does not compress the merged PDF. By default all PDF enclosures will be merged if the primary print format is PDF. Set to false to turn off merging of PDF enclosures.TRUEmerge.alwayspdfIf you have a non-PDF primary document with PDF enclosures, by default the PDF enclosures are not merged. Set to true to enable PDF enclosures to be merged when the primary print format is non-PDF. When set to true, the content in the PDF enclosures is merged.FALSEmerge.printChannelBy default non-PDF enclosures are printed separately and merging is disabled. Set to true to enable merging of non-PDF enclosures, including PostScript and AFP.FALSEmerge.taggedpdfIf you require accessible or tagged PDFs to be produced then we recommend this setting is set to true. Otherwise the merged PDF will not be properly tagged.TRUEinline-cssEmbed CSS for an HTML page into the HTML at an inline levelFALSErender-track-changesShow track changesFALSEprint.mimicformatIf print format is XML, mimic an alternate format when rendering the document"XML"preview.excludeExclude the master channel from any document mergeFALSEhtml.normalizespaceRemove indentation in the XHTMLFALSE This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /v10/job/finalizeDraft endpoint

[[GenerateDocumentNonMultiPart]]
== Generate Document
`<sc-docgen:generate-document-non-multi-part>`


Generates a document. When you generate a document as HTML that includes images, you will need to implement additional code to make the images available on a cache you can access. This is because by default the document contains links to the images that are stored in an authenticated cache, so you will not see them when sent in an email. The following properties can be used as property values in the document request. The properties available to generate a document are: Property nameDescriptionDefault valuemerge.pdfIf you have a PDF primary document with PDF enclosures, the enclosures are merged with the primary document to give a single PDF. This merging process does not compress the merged PDF. By default all PDF enclosures will be merged if the primary print format is PDF.
