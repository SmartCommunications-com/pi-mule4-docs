[[SubmitJob]]
== Submit Job
`<sc-bulk:submit-job>`


Submits a job for processing. Available Job Type options: Type of JobDescriptionTransaction FileUsed to process a single input data file. This file must be in the location set in the 'input' property, or the transaction data must be provided inline in the 'inputData' property.Draft FileUsed when you want to submit one draft file as one job. You can submit either portable or standard non-portable drafts. You can provide either a valid file location or URL in the 'input' property. Or provide inline draft content in the 'inputData' property. When DRAFT_FILE is selected, no 'config' property (template selector) is required.Draft FolderUsed when you want to submit more than one draft file as one job (collate multiple drafts into one job). You can include both portable and standard non-portable drafts. These draft files must be in the location set in the 'input' property, and must be valid .DRAFT files (the file extension is not case sensitive). The order that the draft files are processed is based on the file's date modified - the oldest file in the folder is processed first. When DRAFT_FOLDER is selected, no 'config' property (template selector) is required. When the job starts running on a hybrid appliance, the job ID is appended to the name of the draft files in the input folder so they aren't processed again (only new files will be processed in the next job). Files are not renamed in S3 buckets (or other cloud storage) when using the Pure Cloud AWS platform.Transaction FolderUsed when you want to submit more than one input XML data file as one job (collate multiple transactions into one file). These XML files must be in the location set in the 'input' property. Input XML data files must be valid .XML files and must contain data (the file extension is not case sensitive). The order that the input XML data files are processed is based on the file's date modified - the oldest file in the folder is processed first. When the job starts running on a hybrid appliance, the job ID is appended to the name of the XML files in the input folder so they aren't processed again (only new files will be processed in the next job). Files are not renamed in S3 buckets (or other cloud storage) when using the Pure Cloud AWS platform. This property is optional. If not specified, the job type will be set to TRANSACTION_FILE. The following properties can be used to define the tests run for a job when using Validate: PropertyDescriptionsc.test.descriptionType a brief description of the test. Optionalsc.test.assertion.expectedJobStatusThe expected final status of the job.For example: FINISHED (Completed)FAILED (Error)FINISHED_W_WORKFLOW (Completed with Draft Exceptions)This job property identifies a job as a test job. If this property is missing, the job will be processed like a regular bulk job.sc.test.assertion.compare.baselineThe job ID whose output you want to use as the basis for comparison. Any test job can be used as a baseline.For example: sc.test.assertion.compare.baseline= &lt;baseline job ID&gt;The baseline job output needs to be available at &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;baseline job ID&gt;. If this folder has been deleted, then the test will error, and the job diagnostics log will contain the information that the baseline directory is missing. If set, one or both of sc.test.assertion.compare.intermediate and sc.test.assertion.compare.final need to be set. If not set, the output of this job is not compared. Optional.sc.test.assertion.compare.intermediateDefines if the final output documents are compared.Possible values: sc.test.assertion.compare.final=truesc.test.assertion.compare.final=falseIf the final output documents are compared, the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;baseline job ID&gt;/final/envelope folder is compared with the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;current job ID&gt;/final/envelope folder and the sc.test.assertion.compare.finalDefines if the final output documents are compared.Possible values: sc.test.assertion.compare.final=truesc.test.assertion.compare.final=falseIf the final output documents are compared, the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;baseline job ID&gt;/final/envelope folder is compared with the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;current job ID&gt;/final/envelope folder and the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;baseline job ID&gt;/final/bin folder is compared with the &lt;testoutput&gt;/testruns/&lt;current job ID&gt;/final/bin folder.Any additions/changes/deletions to files are reported in the final comparison report. Optional.sc.test.exclusion.pageSpecifies the Bin output pages that should be excluded from final comparison. Type a comma-separated list of page ranges, single page numbers, and keywords. For example: FIRSTLASTLAST-189-12FIRST,2-5,LAST-1,LASTOptional.sc.test.exclusion.dataSpecify the data items that should be excluded from intermediate comparisons. This can be used to exclude items that you know will change such as date/time, or customer's first name. This does not apply to final comparisons. Type a comma-separated list of system data items and business data items.System data items: getSystemVariables.getCurrentDategetSystemVariables.getVersiongetSystemVariables.isProductiongetJobVariables.getBatchIdgetJobVariables.getTransactionNogetJobVariables.getEffectiveDategetJobVariables.getIdiomgetJobVariables.getIdiomNamegetJobVariables.getLanguagegetJobVariables.getLanguageNamegetJobVariables.getJurisdictiongetJobVariables.getJurisdictionNamegetResourceVariables.getResourceIdgetResourceVariables.getResourceVersionIdgetResourceVariables.getNamegetResourceVariables.getVersiongetResourceVariables.getFullPathgetResourceVariables.getDescriptiongetResourceVariables.getEffectiveDateFromgetResourceVariables.isReleasedgetSystemVariables.getNamegetResourceVariables.effectiveDateToBusiness data items: customer.customername.firstnamecustomer.transactions.lineitem[].description Config Data size must be less than 1 MB Input Data size must be less than 10 MB Range is used to limit the number of transactions from the input data that you process in this job. Note that if you specify a range, this is a subset of every transaction in every file in a folder (for TRANSACTION_FOLDER). For example, if a folder contains 10 files each with 10 transactions, the maximum number of transactions is 100. So if you specify a range of 10, this will limit the job to the transactions in the first file only. If not specified, all transactions are used. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /api/v7/jobs endpoint
